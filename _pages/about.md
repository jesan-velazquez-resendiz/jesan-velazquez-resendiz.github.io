I am currently PhD student at [Institute for Theoretical Physics (IFT), UAM-CSIC](https://www.ift.uam-csic.es/) conducting research on Quantum Error Correction (QEC). In addition, I am interested in the topics of open quantum systems, i.e. polaritons, and the connection of quantum mechanics with life, sociology and philosophy.

Academia
======
I did my master's degree in physics at the [Institute of Physics, UNAM](https://www.fisica.unam.mx/) in Mexico with [Dr. Yuri G. Rubo](https://www.ier.unam.mx/academicos/ygr/) as my supervisor. My research focused on studying quantum properties and performing a semiclassical analysis of a polaritonic condensate with Parity-Time symmetry (\\(\mathcal{PT}\\)-symmetry) when the dissipation and pumping in the system are balanced. This is significant, as polaritonic condensates exhibit quantum properties at room temperature, making them strong candidates for quantum technologies. Throughout this work, I have carried out a mean-field analysis of the master equation governing the system, solved the spin dynamics in the case of \\(\mathcal{PT}\\)-symmetry, analyzed the fixed points and classical chaos in the system, and conducted a numerical analysis of the master equation.

I am now a PhD student at [IFT, UAM](https://www.ift.uam-csic.es/) in Madrid, under the supervision of [Dr. Alejandro Bermudez Carballo](https://www.ift.uam-csic.es/en/one-member/503). My current research centers on Quantum Error Correction (QEC). I remain deeply interested in open quantum systems and in exploring conceptual bridges between quantum mechanics and life sciences—topics that, despite lacking formal theoretical frameworks, I believe hold important open questions worth investigating.

I am passionate about [teaching](https://jesan-velazquez-resendiz.github.io//teaching/). I have been a teaching assistant in three undergraduate courses for electromagnetism and a preparatory course for the Physics Graduate program at UNAM, Mexico. Sharing knowledge is one of my biggest dreams.

Extras
======
Beyond academic life, I enjoy electronic music—particularly artists such as John Digweed, Chemical Brothers, Sasha, Hernán Cattáneo, Patrice Bäumel, among others. Football has been a lifelong passion and source of personal strength, but I also enjoy playing volleyball and handball. Additionally, I have a strong interest in magic, especially card magic (in which I am a beginner). I find it fascinating how card tricks can capture the essence of both life and quantum mechanics; in fact, many aspects of quantum phenomena can be metaphorically illustrated through a well-executed performance.
