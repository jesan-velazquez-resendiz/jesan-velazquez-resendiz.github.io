Who am I? The most difficult question to answer, there is no correct answer. But, here goes!

Academia
======
I am a master's student in physics. My research is about quantum many-body systems, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and out-of-equilibrium systems. I study a polariton condensate and analyze their semiclassical limit where the Parity-Time (\\(\mathcal{PT}\\)) symmetry is present. I am studying the quantum regime through the Lindblad master equation formalism, where I am calculating its properties with numerical methods. I've participated as a speaker in advanced Quantum Fluids of Light conferences and in the National Physics Congress of Mexico.

In addition to my reasearch, I am familiar with mean-field analysis (numerical and theoretical), quantum field theory for condensed matter and atomic systems, Gross-Pitaevski equation, Feynman diagrams, Green functions, Lindblad master equations, advanced quantum mechanics, and numerical analysis of quantum many-body systems.

I am passionate about [teaching](https://jesan-velazquez-resendiz.github.io//teaching/). I have been a teaching assitant in three undergraduate courses for electromagnetism and a preparatory course for the Physics Graduate program at UNAM, Mexico. Sharing knowledge is one of my biggest dreams.

My research interests lie in the understanding of condensed matter, quantum many-body systems and quantum fluids of light. Specifically, the connection with quantum information (i.e. quantum chaos and scrambling) and the possible apllications in quantum technologies, such as quantum computing.

Extras
======
I am a beginner card magician, and I love how card magic connects with quantum physics and how you can explain quantum effects with cards! Yes, it's possible!

Sports are part of my life since I was a child. Football is my biggest passion, that's why I know the best team in the world is the FC Barcelona (Visca Bar√ßa)! I am a fan of volleyball and handball too.

I love reading science, science fiction and horror (Lovecraft is my favorite in this). And learning about sociology was in my life since I was a little kid, so from time to time I read about it.
