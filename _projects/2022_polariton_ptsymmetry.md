In this project I was a research assistant. My activities were the theoretical calculation of the dynamics of the polaritonic condensate and the numerical analysis of the fixed points. I solve the dynamics of the spin for the Hamiltonian describing a Bose-Hubbard dimer with \\(\mathcal{PT}\\) symmetry and found the fixed points numerically and their differente regimes depending on the dissipation of the system. We concluded that the system can be used as a qubit.
