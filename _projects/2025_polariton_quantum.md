**This project is still in progress...**

*This project was developed within the framework of the Support Program for Research and Technological Innovation Projects (PAPIIT).*

As a research assistant, I am responsable of the theoretical and numerical calculations of the quantum many-body system describing a polaritonic condensate with two modes, diagonal and antidiagonal polarizations. We are interested in the coherence function of th two modes, the probability distribution of the number of particles, among other quantum properties. We are using the Lindblad master equation to understand the phenomenology, and for the numerical calculations we are using python (qutip) and Mathematica.
