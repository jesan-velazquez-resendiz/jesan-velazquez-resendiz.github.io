Five minute talk presenting how the results of the wprk [of my bachelor degree](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.085312) could be used in quantum computing and how it could improve the situation of the noise. You can see the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwjHAIHlECQ&list=PL9bVu7c5BjLPSUJKkeLHX4EaAIP8NE_xk&index=23).
